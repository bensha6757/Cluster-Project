# Cluster - Community Structure in Networks

In complex networks, a network is said to have community structure if the nodes of the
network can be grouped into groups of nodes with dense connections internally, and sparser
connections between groups.
In this project I implemented an algorithm for detecting community structures (or clusters) in a network.
